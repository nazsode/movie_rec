This project is made with OpenAI and Streamlit. So we need to install them.

```bash
pip install openai
```

and 

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

Before starting the project, dont forget to paste your own OpenAI key into the movie_recommendation.py file.

Now the project is ready to start.
```bash
streamlit run movie_recommendation.py
```

IT's going to open the web page on your browser. You can now get your movie recommendations.

This project is made with OpenAI and Streamlit. So We need to install them.
```bash
pip install openai
```
and 
```bash
pip install streamlit
```
Now the project is ready to start.
```bash
streamlit run movie_recommendation.py
```
IT's going to open the web page on your browser. You can now get your movie recommendations.
